# RickOs

## Description
This is a Learning project to dive deeper into Operating Systems by essentially building my own.
I am very intrested in how OS's work in low level, what kind of concepts are used. This will be a simple OS with a minimal Kernel and VGA Text mode following the blog from Philipp Oppermann
https://os.phil-opp.com/, and extending the programm with additional features.

## Todo
[] Start :)
